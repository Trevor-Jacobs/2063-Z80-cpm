1. Use lsblk to find your Micro SD card name. Mine is mmcblk0 because I use a Micro SD card adapter in an SD card slot on my laptop.
It could also be sdb, sdc etc if you use a USB adapter. BE CERTAIN YOU HAVE THE CORRECT DEVICE TO AVOID DESTROYING DATA! You can run lsblk before you insert your Micro SD card and then run it again after you have inserted your Micro SD card and see what the new device is. That is your Micro SD card.

2. Clear the Micro SD card before making a partition:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 conv=fsync count=264192 status=progress

3. Make a partion on the Micro SD card with parted:

sudo parted /dev/mmcblk0
GNU Parted 3.4
Using /dev/mmcblk0

4. Write a disk image to a disk slot on the disk partition. Slots are numbered 0-15. Each slot is
16384 blocks in size (0x4000). seek=01x16384 - 16384 in decimal is the start of the 
second disk slot. You don't need the seek statement for disk 0, but it's included for consistency.
Currently all disk slots 0-15 are supported by the Z80 Retro. It supports 16 8MB disks.

Slot 0: sudo dd if=0.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=512 seek=00x16384 conv=fsync status=progress
Slot 1: sudo dd if=1.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=512 seek=01x16384 conv=fsync status=progress
Slot 2: sudo dd if=2.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=512 seek=02x16384 conv=fsync status=progress
Slot 3: sudo dd if=3.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=512 seek=03x16384 conv=fsync status=progress
.
.
.
Slot 15: sudo dd if=15.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=512 seek=15x16384 conv=fsync status=progress

You don't have to write to each slot in any order. For instance if you wanted a new disk image in 
slot 3, you could just write the new image to slot 3. It won't effect the other slots. The image in 
slot 0 must contain the BIOS (retro.bin) or it won't boot. See John's note on CP/M Tools and creating
disk images here: https://github.com/Z80-Retro/2063-Z80-cpm/blob/main/filesystem/README.md

If you want to copy a disk image from a slot on your Micro SD Card partition back to your PC, here is the command:

Slot 0: sudo if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=0.img bs=512 skip=00x16384 count=16384 conv=fsync status=progress
Slot 1: sudo if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=1.img bs=512 skip=01x16384 count=16384 conv=fsync status=progress
Slot 2: sudo if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=2.img bs=512 skip=02x16384 count=16384 conv=fsync status=progress
Slot 3: sudo if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=3.img bs=512 skip=03x16384 count=16384 conv=fsync status=progress
.
.
.
Slot 15: sudo if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=15.img bs=512 skip=15x16384 count=16384 conv=fsync status=progress

If you want to back up your entire Micro SD card (129MiB - not just the partition), here is the command:
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=backup.img bs=512 conv=fsync count=264192 status=progress

To burn the backup to a new Micro SD card:
sudo dd if=backup.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 conv=fsync status=progress
